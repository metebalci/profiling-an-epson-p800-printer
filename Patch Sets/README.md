# Patch Sets

The default setting in the current i1Profiler (3.8.4) (when Advanced > Printer > Profiling is opened) is 2033 patches. The scrambled (randomized) set is saved as `i1_2033.txt`. The patches in this set are semi-regularly sampled including a number of neutral and near-neutral patches (155 according to [this post](https://forum.luminous-landscape.com/index.php?topic=118987.0)). `i1_2033` fits into 2x A4 (6x6), 3x A4 (9x6), 1x A3 (6x6) or 2x A3 (9x6).

You can see the regular sampling of color space by this patch set:
